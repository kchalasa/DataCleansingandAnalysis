# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

### Source Data : Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained from:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

License for this data is included at the bottom of this page.

### Tidy Data for this projects:

This experiments was carried out on 30 volunteers and their activities(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on their waist. Using the sensors in this phone, a lot of data were gathered.
A subset of the features(68) were used for this analysis. These features have been names in the "features.txt" file and described in "features_info.txt" file.

###The dataset includes the following files:

* 'README.md'

* 'CodeBook.md' : This code book describes the variables, the data, and all the transformations performed to clean this data.

* 'features.txt' : List of all feature names included in the 'tidydata.txt'.

* 'run_analysis.R' : A script in "R Programming Language" to download the zipped data from UCI website, unzip it and then 
					 transform this data using the "Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project" guidelines to prepare a tidy subset of source data.

					 * 'tidydata.txt' : Output from the run_analysis.R script.
